    phaseIntroduction: `<div>This is going great. We established that our work-station is the MitM and the two targets are plc1 and plc3.</div> <br>
<div><span class="has-text-weight-bold">As a quick recap:</span> The intruder poisoned the ARP caches of plc1 (10.0.0.1) and plc3 (10.0.0.3). 
So instead of communicating directly with each other, all communication between them goes through the compromised work-station (10.0.0.5), fulfilling the role of the MitM in this attack.
